                                                developer. He grew up in Thakurgaon, Bangladesh, with a supportive
                                                family who encouraged his passion for technology at an early age. He
                                                pursued his studies at BRAC University and later co-founded BinaryPoets.

                                                Masum grew up in Thakurgaon with his siblings. His father, a respected
                                                educator, inspired his pursuit of knowledge and innovation. His late

                                                perseverance. Today, Masum is committed to contributing to the tech

                                                When Bill and Paul Allen started Microsoft, their vision of “a computer
                                                on every desktop and in every home”

                                                seemed farfetched to most people. Today, thanks to Microsoft and many
